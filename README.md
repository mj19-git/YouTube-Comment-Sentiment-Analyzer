# 🎬 YouTube Comment Sentiment Analyzer

This project focuses on analyzing audience sentiment from YouTube trailer comments using **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **deep learning models**. It classifies comments into **positive**, **negative** or **neutral** categories to better understand viewer reactions.



## 🔍 Project Overview

* Developed an end-to-end **sentiment analysis system** tailored for YouTube trailer comments.
* Achieved **90% classification accuracy** by leveraging NLP techniques and transformer-based models (HuggingFace).
* Combined **rule-based sentiment analysis (VADER)** with **deep learning (BERT)** for improved robustness.
* Processed and cleaned real YouTube comment data using Python, NLTK and Pandas.
* Visualized sentiment trends with **Matplotlib** and **WordClouds** to surface dominant themes and viewer emotions.
* Improved processing pipeline efficiency by **88%** through streamlined data handling and optimized code structure.
